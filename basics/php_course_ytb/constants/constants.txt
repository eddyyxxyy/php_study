Let's talk about Constants...

Constants are a type of variables that
their values can not change once they're
defined.

````
<?php

// Constants

// define('STATUS_PAID', 'paid');
const STATUS_PAID = 'paid';

?>
````

There are two ways for defining Constants:

- By using a function called define;
    - define(<name>, <value>)
- By using const keyword:
    - const <name> = <value>;

When echoing Constants we don't need to use
the $ sign.

To check if the Constant were defined, you can
use defined() function.

````
<?php

// Constants

const STATUS_PAID = 'paid';

echo defined('STATUS_PAID');  // returns bool - 1 or 0

echo STATUS_PAID;

?>
````

While const statements run at compile time, define function
are at run time.

That means you can't use const definitions within your control
structures.

````
<?php

// const STATUS_PAID = 'paid';

if(true) {
    // const FOO = 'bar'; -> WRONG
    define('STATUS_PAID', 'paid');
}

?>
````

There are a few magic constants in PHP, so, just
type in PHP and try to look at them.
